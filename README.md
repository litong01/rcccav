The above command will start the server on any nic and at port 80. This
command will only be suitable for development.


To produce a distribution, run the following command:

    ./activator dist

The above command will produce a distribution of the application in the
following directory:

    target/universal/rcccav-1.0.zip

This file can be downloaded, then unzip. To run the service in the production
mode, simply run bin/rcccav from command line.

    bin/rcccav -Dhttp.address=0.0.0.0 -Dhttp.port=80

To build a Ubuntu native package so that it can be installed as a Ubuntu
service, run the following command:

    ./activate debian:packageBin

The above command will create a debian package named rcccav_1.0_all.deb in
target directory. Then you can simply run the following command to install
it to a brand new machine after you download that file.

    sudo dpkg -i rcccav_1.0_all.deb
